### About me

Hello everyone, my name is Valery and I am a qualified design engineer in the field of mechanical engineering. Graduated from BSTU "VOENMEH" in the city of St. Petersburg in the field of rocket science. However, since 2022, I have been working hard in the direction of software development. I started to show interest in programming from the 3rd year, modulating simple processes in the Matlab environment. After graduating from the university, I had and still have many programmer friends, so the opportunity to plunge into the IT world often turned up. 

Currently focused on front-end web development. On my own, thanks to YouTube and web tutorials, I studied technologies such as git, ide, css, sass, JS core. In February 2023, I learned about RS school from a friend. I plan to finish the 3rd stage of training in The Rolling Scopes and get a dream job - a job as a web developer, then level up to a full stack. In some future I plan to get a higher education in the field of artificial intelligence. However, this is already quite distant plans ...

### Code example

```
function longestConsec(strarr, k) {
    if (strarr.length == 0 || k > strarr.length || k < 0) return ``;
    
    const arrOfSums = strarr.map( (item, index, arr) => {
      arr[index] = strarr.slice(index, index + k).join(``);
      return arr[index];
    } );
    
    let longestString = arrOfSums[0];
    arrOfSums.forEach( (item) => {
      longestString = (longestString.length < item.length ) ? item : longestString;
    } );
    
    return longestString
}
```
